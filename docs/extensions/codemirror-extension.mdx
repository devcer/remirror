## Features

### Formatting

Code blocks can be formatted for many different languages. For example, JavaScript code will be formatted differently from markdown or JSON code.

For a list of supported languages, please consult [refractor](https://github.com/wooorm/refractor/tree/main/lang), which we use under the hood.

### Keyboard support

Users can create a new code block by typing <code>&grave;&grave;&grave;&nbsp;</code> (3 ticks and a space). Users can define the language of the code block by typing <code>&grave;&grave;&grave;html&nbsp;</code>.

## Usage

### Installation

This extension is NOT installed for you when you install the main `remirror` package but need to be installed separately:

```bash
npm install @remirror/extension-codemirror6
```

You can use the imports in the following way:

```ts
import { CodeMirrorExtension } from '@remirror/extension-codemirror6';
```
